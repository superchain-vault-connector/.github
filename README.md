# Superchain Vault Connector (SVC)

**Cross-Chain Vaults for the Superchain Era.**

The **Superchain Vault Connector (SVC)** is an open-source protocol designed to enable seamless cross-chain deposit and borrowing across the Optimism Superchain. Built as a next-generation evolution of [Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC)](https://evc.wtf/docs/concepts/what-is-evc) and powered by [Opstack interoperability](https://docs.optimism.io/interop/explainer), SVC simplifies asset management across multiple chains within the Superchain.

## üöÄ What Does SVC Do?

SVC creates a unified vault layer across all Opstack chains that support interop, allowing users and protocols to:

- **Deposit on one chain, borrow from another**
- **Manage liquidity seamlessly across Superchain ecosystems**
- **Reduce fragmentation and operational overhead**
- **Build cross-chain DeFi apps with ease**

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Foundations

SVC is built on:

- **EVC**: A secure vault management layer for EVM chains, enabling composable vault interactions.
- **Opstack Interop**: Cross-domain messaging and it enable a network of chains, the Superchain, to feel like a single blockchain.

Together, they empower SVC to coordinate vault operations across the Superchain with high reliability and efficiency.
